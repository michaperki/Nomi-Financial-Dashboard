# Nomi Financial Dashboard
This project is a part of [Nomi Health](https://nomihealth.com/g).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to clean and compile several Excel models and output a dataset powering a BI Dashboard. This repository stores the scripts for data import, transform, and export. The project is designed to run modularly in VSCode and then compile into a single text file for injection into Domo, using the "compile_scripts.py" helper tool.

### Methods Used
* Data Science Techniques (group by, pivot, melt, etc.)
* Key Creation and Mapping (joining)
* Data Visualization
* GitHub CoPilot and ChatGPT for code improvement

### Technologies
* Python (libraries listed below)
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Logging
* Domo BI Tool

## Project Description
Data is provided by the Nomi Financial team and sent straight to Domo via Domo's automated 'upload via email' connector. This codebase replaces a time and labor intensive process created by a consulting team and maintained in Excel models. The data consists of Projected and Actual spend (Monthly and Quarterly spend files are supplied separately), allocation files for each Expense Bucket, and a name map for cross-referencing between the actuals and projections. The specific visualizations required necessitate several different operations (see below).

## Process
At the highest level, the process is as follows:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A(<b>Initialize</b> <ol><li>detect environment</li><li>declare constants</li><li>create output list</li>) --> B;
    B(<b>Monthly Calculation</b></b> <ol><li>import data</li><li>transform</li><li>add to output list</li>) --> C(Headcount Calculation);
    C(<b>Headcount Calculation</b> <ol><li>import/transform/output</li>) --> D;
    D(<b>Delta Calculation</b> <ol><li>import/transform/output</li>) --> E;
    E(<b>Quarterly Calculation</b> <ol><li>import/transform/output</li>) --> F;
    F(<b>QM Diff Calculation</b> <ol><li>use monthly and quarterly outputs</li><li>add to output list</li>) --> G;
    G(<b>Analysis Calculation</b> <ol><li>import/transform/output</li>) --> H;
    H(<b>Dashboard Health</b> <ol><li>complete data validation</li><li>add to output list</li>) --> I(<b>Output Data</b> <ol><li>concatenate output list</li><li>write to Domo</li>);

```
### Initialize
The script runs in both VSCode and Domo. The [detect_environment](https://github.com/michaperki/Nomi-Financial-Dashboard/blob/main/scripts/detect_environment.py) function uses the ```os``` library to detect whether it is being run locally or in Domo. It returns a boolean constant ```RUNNING_IN_DOMO```.
All constants and the empty output list are declared in [constants](https://github.com/michaperki/Nomi-Financial-Dashboard/blob/main/scripts/constants.py).

### Monthly Calculation
The monthly calculation is the main transform of this ETL. It involves reformatting and cleaning the data, joining the allocations, and merging the Actuals and Projections.
The [main script](https://github.com/michaperki/Nomi-Financial-Dashboard/blob/main/scripts/_main_.py) runs the monthly calculations. 

#### Data Import
First, the main script retrieves the data using [get_data](https://github.com/michaperki/Nomi-Financial-Dashboard/blob/main/scripts/get_data.py). Each file has a dictionary declared in [constants](https://github.com/michaperki/Nomi-Financial-Dashboard/blob/main/scripts/constants.py) with the relevant file path in Domo and locally. The get_data function accepts this dictionary (and the ```RUNNING_IN_DOMO``` boolean) to retrieve the data in either environment.

##### Actual File Date
The ```ACTUAL_FILE_DATE``` is an integer representing the month of Actuals data available. Per the [Upload Checklist](https://nomihealth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~6268326934b9b700687acfc6/pages/1906639311/Upload+Checklist), the Actuals must include a month name in the file (three-letter abbreviation also accepted). This month is extracted as an integer using [get_actuals_date](https://github.com/michaperki/Nomi-Financial-Dashboard/blob/main/scripts/get_actuals_date.py) and the ```ACTUAL_FILE_DATE``` stores that value.

**_NOTE:_**  During the first few months of the year, there is no Actuals data available. During this time, the boolean ```FIRST_RUN_OF_YEAR``` should be switched to ```True```. This will set ```ACTUAL_FILE_DATE``` and allow the script to run. The ```DELTA_CONTROLLER``` should also be switched off at this time.




#### Data Validation
Before cleaning the data, we take stock of our input numbers to compare with our final output using [setup_data_validation](https://github.com/michaperki/Nomi-Financial-Dashboard/blob/main/scripts/setup_data_validation.py)

#### Data Cleaning
Next, the main script cleans the projections, actuals, and allocations using the
